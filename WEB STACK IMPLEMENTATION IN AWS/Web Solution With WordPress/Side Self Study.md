## Three-tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that divides an application into three distinct layers: the Presentation Tier, the Logic Tier, and the Data Tier. This separation allows for more scalable, manageable, and maintainable applications.

### 1. Presentation Tier

The Presentation Tier is the topmost level of the application and directly interacts with the end-users. It is responsible for presenting data to the user and interpreting user commands.

**Technologies**:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Front-end frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js

### 2. Logic Tier (Application Tier)

The Logic Tier contains the business logic of the application. It processes user inputs from the Presentation Tier, performs computations, makes logical decisions, and interacts with the Data Tier to retrieve or store data.

**Technologies**:
- Server-side languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Python (Django, Flask), Ruby on Rails, Java (Spring), or .NET

### 3. Data Tier

The Data Tier is responsible for storing and managing data. It retrieves data from the database and sends it to the Logic Tier when requested, and stores data when instructed by the Logic Tier.

**Technologies**:
- Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Oracle

### Benefits of Three-tier Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each tier has a specific responsibility, making the application more modular and easier to manage.
- **Scalability**: Each tier can be scaled independently based on the load and demand.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one tier do not necessarily impact the other tiers, making the system easier to update and maintain.
- **Reusability**: Components of each tier can be reused across different projects or applications.

### Example Scenario

To illustrate the Three-tier Architecture, consider a web-based e-commerce application:

1. **Presentation Tier**: The user interface that customers interact with. It displays product listings, shopping carts, and order forms.
2. **Logic Tier**: Processes user requests such as adding items to the cart, checking out, and processing payments. It contains the applicationâ€™s business logic.
3. **Data Tier**: Manages data related to products, user accounts, and orders in a database.

By separating these concerns, the application becomes more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.
